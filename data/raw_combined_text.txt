Open an Account

We all know about savings accounts with banks. It allows easy access to our funds while offering security from theft and mishandling. A Demat account does the same for investors. Nowadays, the Demat account is a prerequisite for stock investment.
Demat Account is an account that is used to hold shares and securities in electronic format. The full form of Demat account is a dematerialised account. The purpose of opening a Demat account is to hold shares that have been bought or dematerialised (converted from physical to electronic shares), thus making share trading easy for the users during online trading.
In India, depositories such as NSDL and CDSL provide Free Demat account services. Intermediaries, depository participants or stockbrokers - like Angel One - facilitate these services. Each intermediary may have Demat account charges that vary as per volume held in the account, type of subscription, and terms and conditions between a depository and a stockbroker.
What is Demat account?
A Demat Account or Dematerialised Account provides the facility of holding shares and securities in an electronic format. During online trading, shares are bought and held in a Demat Account, thus, facilitating easy trade for the users. A Demat Account holds all the investments an individual makes in shares, government securities, exchange-traded funds, bonds and mutual funds in one place.
Demat enabled the digitisation process of the Indian stock trading market and enforced better governance by SEBI. In addition, the Demat account reduced the risks of storing, theft, damage, and malpractices by storing securities in electronic format. It was first introduced in 1996 by NSE. Initially, the account opening process was manual, and it took investors several days to get it activated. Today, one can open a Demat account online in 5 mins. The end-to-end digital process has contributed to popularising Demat, which skyrocketed in the pandemic.
What is dematerialisation?
Dematerialisation is the process of converting the physical share certificates into electronic form, which is a lot easier to maintain and is accessible from anywhere throughout the world. An investor who wants to trade online needs to open a Demat with a Depository Participant (DP). The purpose of is to eliminate the need for the investor to hold physical share certificates and facilitating a seamless tracking and monitoring of holdings.
Earlier, the share certificate issuance process was time-consuming and cumbersome, which Demat has helped transform by speeding the entire process and storing security certificates in digital format. Once your Demat account is active, you can convert paper certificates into digital format by submitting all your physical securities along with a Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF). Also, remember to deface each physical certificate by mentioning ‘ Surrendered for Dematerialisation’ on it. You will receive an acknowledgement slip when you surrender your share certificates.

How does a Demat Account work?
Trading through a Demat account is similar to the procedure of physical trading, except that a Demat account is electronic. You begin trading by placing an order through your online trading account. For this purpose, it is necessary to link both trading and Demat accounts. Once an order is placed, the exchange will process the order. Demat account details the market price of shares and the availability of shares is verified before the final processing of the order. On completion of the processing, shares are then reflected in your statement of holdings. When a shareholder wishes to sell shares, a delivery instruction note has to be provided with details of the stock. Shares are then debited from the account and the equivalent cash value is credited to the trading account.
Having a Demat account is compulsory per the Depository Act passed in 1996. To facilitate it, the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) was formed in 1996. And, the Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) became the second such institution three years later. Together the two agencies are the custodian of all the electronic securities held by investors. They offer the Demat account opening service through various depository participants, like Angel One. Both agencies and their partner brokers are registered with SEBI.
The Demat account opening process involves three parties - your bank, the depository participant, and the depository. Tagging your bank account with your Demat account is critical for trading seamlessly. Linking your account details ensure when you buy shares, the money gets debited directly from your bank account, and when you sell, the proceeds get automatically credited.
A depository participant can be a non-banking financial institution, a bank, or a stockbroker. You would need to approach a DP to open a Demat account. The third party is obviously the depository. They hold the Demat account on your behalf.
Types of Demat account
While opening a Demat account, investors need to select a Demat account type that suits their profile carefully. The most common type is a regular Demat account. Any Indian investor or resident Indian can open a standard Demat account within a few minutes using an online account opening process. Apart from the standard Demat account, there are two other types. Let's take a look at them.
There are two types of Demat accounts—Repatriable Demat account and Non-repatriable Demat account. Repatriable funds are deposited in a separate bank account known as the Non-Resident External Account (NRE account). Repatriable funds are those funds which can be transferred abroad. The investments made from these funds are maintained in a The Repatriable Demat account holds the investments made from repatriable funds. On the other hand, non-repatriable funds (funds which cannot be taken/transferred abroad) are deposited in a different bank account known as the Non Resident Ordinary Account (NRO account).The Non-repatriable Demat account holds the investments made from non-repatriable funds. Money can easily be transferred from an NRE to an NRO account. However, once the transfer is made, the repatriability is lost and the money cannot be transferred back to the NRE account.
Regular Demat account: Regular Demat account is for resident Indian investors who want to trade in shares alone and need a storing for securities. The stocks get debited from your Demat account when you sell and credited when you purchase during trading. If you are trading in F&O, you don't need a Demat account because these contracts don't need storage.
Basic Services Demat Account: It is a new type of Demat account introduced by the SEBI. These accounts don't have maintenance changes if the holding value is less than Rs 50,000. Between Rs 50,000 and 2 lakh, the changes are Rs 100. The new type of account targets new investors who are yet to open a Demat account.
Repatriable Demat Account: Non-resident Indian investors open a repatriable account to transfer their earnings from the Indian market abroad. If you want to open a repatriable account, you'll have to close your regular Demat account in India and open a non-resident external account to receive payments.
Non-repatriable account: This account is also for non-resident Indians, but it doesn't allow fund transfer to foreign locations.
SEBI has made it mandatory for investors to have a Demat account. You can't trade in the Indian stock exchange if you don't have a Demat. Update yourself on the account opening process, charges, and select a trusted depository participant.
There is a list of documents needed to open a Demat account, including personal details and bank/income details. Here is a list of the documents required.
Proof of identity
Proof of address
Proof of income
Proof of bank account
PAN card
Passport size photographs
The online method has made the account opening process simple. You can now set up a Demat account by submitting documents and completing KYC online.

Demat: Demat stands for dematerialisation. It is a process of storing securities in a digital format. SEBI has made the Demat account mandatory for stocks investors.
Depository participant: A depository participant is an agent of the depository, offering Demat account opening services. They are registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Depository: A depository holds and offers a Demat account. In fact, all securities owned by investors in digital format are stored with the depositories. There are two primary depositories - NSDL and CDSL. All depository participants (DP) are listed with a depository.
NSDL: NSDL stands for National Securities Depository Limited. It was formed in 1996 when the Demat account was introduced to the Indian stock market. As of November 30, 2021, NSDL had 2,45,96,176 active investors accounts.
CDSL: The Central Depository Services Ltd is the other depository besides NSDL. It has 592 enlisted partners and 5,26,37,291 active accounts.
Electronic Certificate: Bank account, trading account, and Demat account are the three essential necessities while dealing with investments.

Central Depository (CD): Central Depository is basically a central agency that maintains all the relevant information pertaining to Demat accounts that are opened with DPs throughout the country. India’s central depository agencies include National Services Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL).
Depository Participants (DP): The DPs or Depository Participants are fundamental intermediaries between the account holders and the Central Depository. DP’s include several banks, brokerage firms, and other financial institutions that offer investors with Demat accounts.
Transaction Identification: In order to buy and sell electronic securities, every investor needs a trading account, which is as important as a demat account. Every trading account is given a unique identification number that has to be used for all the transactions of an investor.
Portfolio Holding: The Demat account of an investor keeps all his investment holdings of investors including: equity holdings, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, government securities and bonds. All the holdings together are referred to as the investors’ portfolio holding, which they can access through their Demat account. All their purchases are reflected as Demat credits while all their his sale transactions are debited from the Demat account.

Derivatives come handy for protection against price fluctuations. There are two types of derivatives – future and options. Apart from being a hedge against price fluctuations, they can be traded on exchanges such as commodities, stocks, and currency.
Future and option trading enable those, who are disinterested in the underlying asset to profit from price fluctuations. For example, you are interested in F&O trading of wheat. You aren’t interested in hoarding tonnes of grains in your garage but, are keen to benefit from price fluctuations. Then, you can buy wheat futures and options without getting the commodity delivered to you. Most participants in the F&O market are speculators, who are not quite interested in the product. This is good as it contributes to the market’s liquidity.

FAQs
What kinds of assets are available for F&O trading?
There are several kinds of assets available for future option trading. They include agricultural commodities, stocks, minerals, energy, coal, currency, and so on.
Where can I do futures and options trading?
That depends on the underlying asset of the futures and options. For example, if you want to trade in F&O stocks, you will have to do it on a stock exchange like the Bombay Stock Exchange or the National Stock Exchange. If you want to trade in commodities, you will have to do it on a commodities exchange like the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) or National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX).
What is the margin?
When you trade in futures and options, you must deposit a certain amount with your broker. This is called the initial margin. This is a percentage of the value of the transactions you carry out. For example, if the initial margin is 10 percent, and the value of your transactions is Rs 5 lakh, you will need to deposit Rs 50,000 with your broker. Margins are there to protect the broker against risk of volatility. Margins vary from asset to asset, depending on volatility. Generally, margins are lower in commodity markets. Initial margins will also be lower if positions are squared off intra-day. If you carry forward positions, you’ll have higher margins.
If the price of an underlying asset reduces, the broker may ask you to deposit more additional margin money. This is called a `margin call’. The broker may sell the underlying asset without your consent if you don’t pay up the margin. So, you could land in losses if you don’t pay margin money quickly
Which involves more risk – futures or options?
Futures involve more risk than options because when you enter into a futures contract, you must carry through the contract. For example, if you agree to sell 100 shares of Company X at Rs 2,100 per share at a future date, and prices of X fall to Rs 1,900, you will have no option but to go through with the sale. Your losses will thus be (2100-1900) x 100, or Rs 20,000. On the other hand, if you enter into an options contract, there is no compulsion on your part to sell the shares. So, your losses will be restricted to the premium paid on the contract, which will be much lower.
Commodities or equity: Which should I choose?
The potential for profit is there in both kinds of derivatives. However, you must remember that commodity markets are far more volatile than share markets and are affected by a varied set of circumstances. Generally, large institutional players tend to dominate commodity markets.
What is leverage?
Leverage is the volume of transactions you can make with the margin money you have paid. Lower the initial margin, the higher the leverage. For example, if the margin money is 1 percent, by paying Rs 10,000, you can deal in transactions worth Rs 10 lakh. Larger the transactions, more the prospect of profit. However, the downside is that the risks are far higher. If your bet goes wrong, you could end up with huge losses. Leverage in commodities markets are lower; hence, the risks are higher too.
Do I have to hold futures until the maturity date?
No, that’s not required. You can actively trade futures, which means that you can sell or buy them any time before their expiry. For example, you have a futures contract to purchase the shares of Company A at Rs 500 a share on a specific date but, you discover that prices are likely to fall. You can then sell the contract before the expiry date.

Derivatives is a lucrative financial instrument that allows investors to gain from the market volatility. Here you can make large gains by investing a smaller amount using the benefit of leverage. Futures and options are the two most common types of derivatives.

What is trade options?
Options are an asset class that offers investment opportunities beyond the scopes of the traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds. Options trading is when you buy and sell an underlying asset at a predetermined rate after a specific future date. However, options are different from stocks and often, trading stock options is more complex than stock investment.
Trading in options requires you to answer questions about which direction a stock will move, by how much and when it will happen?
New investors often avoid options trading, thinking it is high risk. But that is far from the truth. Once you understand how options work, you can diversify your portfolio further and explore investments with higher profit opportunities.

Types of Trading Account

A Forex account is one which holds deposits in one or more currencies for the purpose of speculation of movement in the foreign exchange market. The commodities market is similar to that of a stock market, except that goods are traded instead of stocks. An online equity account allows you to invest in IPOs, equity, mutual funds and currency derivative instruments. Derivative accounts help make profits by betting on the future value of an underlying asset like currencies, stocks, exchange rates, etc.

Features & Benefits

The main benefit of an online trading account is the ease with which you can manage your stock portfolios without middlemen/brokers. It also gives you greater control to trust your own intuitions and take risks with your investments. Besides, the speed of transactions increases, as everything can be done instantaneously.

Open an Account

We all know about savings accounts with banks. It allows easy access to our funds while offering security from theft and mishandling. A Demat account does the same for investors. Nowadays, the Demat account is a prerequisite for stock investment.
Demat Account is an account that is used to hold shares and securities in electronic format. The full form of Demat account is a dematerialised account. The purpose of opening a Demat account is to hold shares that have been bought or dematerialised (converted from physical to electronic shares), thus making share trading easy for the users during online trading.
In India, depositories such as NSDL and CDSL provide Free Demat account services. Intermediaries, depository participants or stockbrokers - like Angel One - facilitate these services. Each intermediary may have Demat account charges that vary as per volume held in the account, type of subscription, and terms and conditions between a depository and a stockbroker.
What is Demat account?
A Demat Account or Dematerialised Account provides the facility of holding shares and securities in an electronic format. During online trading, shares are bought and held in a Demat Account, thus, facilitating easy trade for the users. A Demat Account holds all the investments an individual makes in shares, government securities, exchange-traded funds, bonds and mutual funds in one place.
Demat enabled the digitisation process of the Indian stock trading market and enforced better governance by SEBI. In addition, the Demat account reduced the risks of storing, theft, damage, and malpractices by storing securities in electronic format. It was first introduced in 1996 by NSE. Initially, the account opening process was manual, and it took investors several days to get it activated. Today, one can open a Demat account online in 5 mins. The end-to-end digital process has contributed to popularising Demat, which skyrocketed in the pandemic.
What is dematerialisation?
Dematerialisation is the process of converting the physical share certificates into electronic form, which is a lot easier to maintain and is accessible from anywhere throughout the world. An investor who wants to trade online needs to open a Demat with a Depository Participant (DP). The purpose of is to eliminate the need for the investor to hold physical share certificates and facilitating a seamless tracking and monitoring of holdings.
Earlier, the share certificate issuance process was time-consuming and cumbersome, which Demat has helped transform by speeding the entire process and storing security certificates in digital format. Once your Demat account is active, you can convert paper certificates into digital format by submitting all your physical securities along with a Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF). Also, remember to deface each physical certificate by mentioning ‘ Surrendered for Dematerialisation’ on it. You will receive an acknowledgement slip when you surrender your share certificates.

How does a Demat Account work?
Trading through a Demat account is similar to the procedure of physical trading, except that a Demat account is electronic. You begin trading by placing an order through your online trading account. For this purpose, it is necessary to link both trading and Demat accounts. Once an order is placed, the exchange will process the order. Demat account details the market price of shares and the availability of shares is verified before the final processing of the order. On completion of the processing, shares are then reflected in your statement of holdings. When a shareholder wishes to sell shares, a delivery instruction note has to be provided with details of the stock. Shares are then debited from the account and the equivalent cash value is credited to the trading account.
Having a Demat account is compulsory per the Depository Act passed in 1996. To facilitate it, the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) was formed in 1996. And, the Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) became the second such institution three years later. Together the two agencies are the custodian of all the electronic securities held by investors. They offer the Demat account opening service through various depository participants, like Angel One. Both agencies and their partner brokers are registered with SEBI.
The Demat account opening process involves three parties - your bank, the depository participant, and the depository. Tagging your bank account with your Demat account is critical for trading seamlessly. Linking your account details ensure when you buy shares, the money gets debited directly from your bank account, and when you sell, the proceeds get automatically credited.
A depository participant can be a non-banking financial institution, a bank, or a stockbroker. You would need to approach a DP to open a Demat account. The third party is obviously the depository. They hold the Demat account on your behalf.
Types of Demat account
While opening a Demat account, investors need to select a Demat account type that suits their profile carefully. The most common type is a regular Demat account. Any Indian investor or resident Indian can open a standard Demat account within a few minutes using an online account opening process. Apart from the standard Demat account, there are two other types. Let's take a look at them.
There are two types of Demat accounts—Repatriable Demat account and Non-repatriable Demat account. Repatriable funds are deposited in a separate bank account known as the Non-Resident External Account (NRE account). Repatriable funds are those funds which can be transferred abroad. The investments made from these funds are maintained in a The Repatriable Demat account holds the investments made from repatriable funds. On the other hand, non-repatriable funds (funds which cannot be taken/transferred abroad) are deposited in a different bank account known as the Non Resident Ordinary Account (NRO account).The Non-repatriable Demat account holds the investments made from non-repatriable funds. Money can easily be transferred from an NRE to an NRO account. However, once the transfer is made, the repatriability is lost and the money cannot be transferred back to the NRE account.
Regular Demat account: Regular Demat account is for resident Indian investors who want to trade in shares alone and need a storing for securities. The stocks get debited from your Demat account when you sell and credited when you purchase during trading. If you are trading in F&O, you don't need a Demat account because these contracts don't need storage.
Basic Services Demat Account: It is a new type of Demat account introduced by the SEBI. These accounts don't have maintenance changes if the holding value is less than Rs 50,000. Between Rs 50,000 and 2 lakh, the changes are Rs 100. The new type of account targets new investors who are yet to open a Demat account.
Repatriable Demat Account: Non-resident Indian investors open a repatriable account to transfer their earnings from the Indian market abroad. If you want to open a repatriable account, you'll have to close your regular Demat account in India and open a non-resident external account to receive payments.
Non-repatriable account: This account is also for non-resident Indians, but it doesn't allow fund transfer to foreign locations.
SEBI has made it mandatory for investors to have a Demat account. You can't trade in the Indian stock exchange if you don't have a Demat. Update yourself on the account opening process, charges, and select a trusted depository participant.
There is a list of documents needed to open a Demat account, including personal details and bank/income details. Here is a list of the documents required.
Proof of identity
Proof of address
Proof of income
Proof of bank account
PAN card
Passport size photographs
The online method has made the account opening process simple. You can now set up a Demat account by submitting documents and completing KYC online.

Derivatives come handy for protection against price fluctuations. There are two types of derivatives – future and options. Apart from being a hedge against price fluctuations, they can be traded on exchanges such as commodities, stocks, and currency.
Future and option trading enable those, who are disinterested in the underlying asset to profit from price fluctuations. For example, you are interested in F&O trading of wheat. You aren’t interested in hoarding tonnes of grains in your garage but, are keen to benefit from price fluctuations. Then, you can buy wheat futures and options without getting the commodity delivered to you. Most participants in the F&O market are speculators, who are not quite interested in the product. This is good as it contributes to the market’s liquidity.

FAQs
What kinds of assets are available for F&O trading?
There are several kinds of assets available for future option trading. They include agricultural commodities, stocks, minerals, energy, coal, currency, and so on.
Where can I do futures and options trading?
That depends on the underlying asset of the futures and options. For example, if you want to trade in F&O stocks, you will have to do it on a stock exchange like the Bombay Stock Exchange or the National Stock Exchange. If you want to trade in commodities, you will have to do it on a commodities exchange like the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) or National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX).
What is the margin?
When you trade in futures and options, you must deposit a certain amount with your broker. This is called the initial margin. This is a percentage of the value of the transactions you carry out. For example, if the initial margin is 10 percent, and the value of your transactions is Rs 5 lakh, you will need to deposit Rs 50,000 with your broker. Margins are there to protect the broker against risk of volatility. Margins vary from asset to asset, depending on volatility. Generally, margins are lower in commodity markets. Initial margins will also be lower if positions are squared off intra-day. If you carry forward positions, you’ll have higher margins.
If the price of an underlying asset reduces, the broker may ask you to deposit more additional margin money. This is called a `margin call’. The broker may sell the underlying asset without your consent if you don’t pay up the margin. So, you could land in losses if you don’t pay margin money quickly
Which involves more risk – futures or options?
Futures involve more risk than options because when you enter into a futures contract, you must carry through the contract. For example, if you agree to sell 100 shares of Company X at Rs 2,100 per share at a future date, and prices of X fall to Rs 1,900, you will have no option but to go through with the sale. Your losses will thus be (2100-1900) x 100, or Rs 20,000. On the other hand, if you enter into an options contract, there is no compulsion on your part to sell the shares. So, your losses will be restricted to the premium paid on the contract, which will be much lower.
Commodities or equity: Which should I choose?
The potential for profit is there in both kinds of derivatives. However, you must remember that commodity markets are far more volatile than share markets and are affected by a varied set of circumstances. Generally, large institutional players tend to dominate commodity markets.
What is leverage?
Leverage is the volume of transactions you can make with the margin money you have paid. Lower the initial margin, the higher the leverage. For example, if the margin money is 1 percent, by paying Rs 10,000, you can deal in transactions worth Rs 10 lakh. Larger the transactions, more the prospect of profit. However, the downside is that the risks are far higher. If your bet goes wrong, you could end up with huge losses. Leverage in commodities markets are lower; hence, the risks are higher too.
Do I have to hold futures until the maturity date?
No, that’s not required. You can actively trade futures, which means that you can sell or buy them any time before their expiry. For example, you have a futures contract to purchase the shares of Company A at Rs 500 a share on a specific date but, you discover that prices are likely to fall. You can then sell the contract before the expiry date.

Derivatives is a lucrative financial instrument that allows investors to gain from the market volatility. Here you can make large gains by investing a smaller amount using the benefit of leverage. Futures and options are the two most common types of derivatives.

What is trade options?
Options are an asset class that offers investment opportunities beyond the scopes of the traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds. Options trading is when you buy and sell an underlying asset at a predetermined rate after a specific future date. However, options are different from stocks and often, trading stock options is more complex than stock investment.
Trading in options requires you to answer questions about which direction a stock will move, by how much and when it will happen?
New investors often avoid options trading, thinking it is high risk. But that is far from the truth. Once you understand how options work, you can diversify your portfolio further and explore investments with higher profit opportunities.

Importance of Trading Account
An online trading account helps you trade financial instruments through the internet. You can execute buy/sell orders at the click of a mouse. It is easy to set up, and offers telephonic and online access. It contains a wealth of information about your trading details. Hence, you can make financially sound decisions to increase profitability. Such an account provides information on gross profit and loss. It also increases the speed of the execution and settlement of trade orders. You can also make as many or as few trades as you desire. Moreover, the cost of online trading is lower compared to traditional physical trading.

Types of Trading Account
There are many types of online accounts available for the purpose of trading securities, stock, gold, ETF’s, currencies, etc. These include Online Forex Trading account, Online Commodities Trading account, Online Currency Trading account, Online Equity Trading account and Online Derivatives Trading account. A Forex account is one which holds deposits in one or more currencies for the purpose of speculation of movement in the foreign exchange market. The commodities market is similar to that of a stock market, except that goods are traded instead of stocks. An online equity account allows you to invest in IPOs, equity, mutual funds and currency derivative instruments. Derivative accounts help make profits by betting on the future value of an underlying asset like currencies, stocks, exchange rates, etc.

Features & Benefits
Online trading account offers feasibility to investors as it is simple, stable and fast to deploy. It enables investors to track movements of tradable assets and securities on a real-time basis. You can have multiple accounts based on your trading strategies. Some may have a trading account for buying and selling long-term stocks, retirement savings, margin accounts, etc. It enables you to set your own personal trading limits and buy/sell orders as per your convenience. An online trading account also reflects the ratio between the cost of goods sold and the gross profit. It also gives you a gist of your transactions, gives you real-time quotes, and provides research tools and technical analysis, thus enabling you to make better trading decisions.

The main benefit of an online trading account is the ease with which you can manage your stock portfolios without middlemen/brokers. It also gives you greater control to trust your own intuitions and take risks with your investments. Besides, the speed of transactions increases, as everything can be done instantaneously. In a traditional set-up, one had to contact his stockbroker, who would then negotiate the price with the trader and place the order. This would often result in transaction delays. Online trading eliminates such issues. You can also monitor your stock as and when you wish, analyse research reports, read finance news and trade even when you are on the go.

Important Questions 
Answers 
Why This Matters: 
What is the overall 
deductible? 
$2,500/individual or $5,000/family   
Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this 
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must 
meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all 
family members meets the overall family deductible. 
Are there services 
covered before you meet 
your deductible? 
Yes. Preventive care services are 
covered before you meet your 
deductible. 
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount.  
But a copayment or coinsurance may apply.  For example, this plan covers certain preventive 
services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered 
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/. 
Are there other 
deductibles for specific 
services? 
No.   
You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see chart starting on page 2 for 
other costs for services this plan covers. 
What is the out-of-pocket 
limit for this plan? 
$7,350/individual or $14,700/family 
The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services.  If you have 
other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the 
overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met. 
What is not included in 
the out-of-pocket limit? 
Premiums, balanced-billing 
charges, and health care this plan 
doesn’t cover. 
Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit. 
Will you pay less if you 
use a network provider? 
No network restrictions.   
 N/A 
Do you need a referral to 
see a specialist? 
No.  You don’t need a referral to see 
a specialist. 
You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.

About these Coverage Examples: 
 
 
 
This is not a cost estimator. Treatments shown are just examples of how this plan might cover medical care. Your actual costs will be 
different depending on the actual care you receive, the prices your providers charge, and many other factors. Focus on the cost sharing 
amounts (deductibles, copayments and coinsurance) and excluded services under the plan. Use this information to compare the portion of 
costs you might pay under different health plans. Please note these coverage examples are based on self-only coverage.

Important Questions 
Answers 
Why This Matters: 
What is the overall 
deductible? 
$5,000/individual or $10,000/family   
Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this 
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must 
meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all 
family members meets the overall family deductible. 
Are there services 
covered before you meet 
your deductible? 
Yes. Preventive care services are 
covered before you meet your 
deductible. 
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount.  
But a copayment or coinsurance may apply.  For example, this plan covers certain preventive 
services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered 
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/. 
Are there other 
deductibles for specific 
services? 
No.   
You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see chart starting on page 2 for 
other costs for services this plan covers. 
What is the out-of-pocket 
limit for this plan? 
$7,350/individual or $14,700/family 
The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services.  If you have 
other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the 
overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met. 
What is not included in 
the out-of-pocket limit? 
Premiums, balanced-billing 
charges, and health care this plan 
doesn’t cover. 
Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit. 
Will you pay less if you 
use a network provider? 
No network restrictions.   
  
Do you need a referral to 
see a specialist? 
No.  You don’t need a referral to see 
a specialist. 
You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.

Important Questions 
Answers 
Why This Matters: 
What is the overall 
deductible? 
$7,350/individual or $14,700/family 
Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this 
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must 
meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all 
family members meets the overall family deductible. 
Are there services 
covered before you meet 
your deductible? 
Yes. Preventive care services are 
covered before you meet your 
deductible. 
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount.  
But a copayment or coinsurance may apply.  For example, this plan covers certain preventive 
services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered 
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/. 
Are there other 
deductibles for specific 
services? 
No.   
You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see chart starting on page 2 for 
other costs for services this plan covers. 
What is the out-of-pocket 
limit for this plan? 
$7,350/individual or $14,700/family 
The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services.  If you have 
other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the 
overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met. 
What is not included in 
the out-of-pocket limit? 
Premiums, balanced-billing 
charges, and health care this plan 
doesn’t cover. 
Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit. 
Will you pay less if you 
use a network provider? 
No network restrictions.   
  
Do you need a referral to 
see a specialist? 
No.  You don’t need a referral to see 
a specialist. 
You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.
